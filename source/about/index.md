Since 2014, Splintered Light Books begin to write for average people who wish to ride bikes. Just about all cycling sites are about persons who can bike seriously quickly - and who seem stunningly good in skintight lycra. We aren't those people! When you are interested in a blog page that's mainly about average persons having fun on bikes, please consider joining our community by subscribing!

Note that these child bike seats aren't ranked in order of desire. Each one offers different benefits and is ideal for a specific age range. For case in point, if your son or daughter is younger than 1 . 5 years, go right to choice no. 3, as the primary two choices are well suited for children who are over the age of 18 months.

## Simply no. 1 : Rear-mounted Thule Trip Along Child Bike Seat

Rear-mounted child bike chairs are suitable for children aged from at least 1 . 5 years and aged. There are two sorts:

- rear-mounted bike seats that attach to the bike frame (generally the seat tube) - they are by far the most prevalent, and are convenient as they utilize whatever impact absorbing system your motorcycle has, and they also also in some cases have their own springs
- rear-mounted bike chairs that put on the bike rack (requires your bicycle to have a suited rack, or eyelets that happen to be designed for mounting a rack).

Many of these rear-mounted kid bikes seats possess springs for comfort, plus some even have a reclining choice! The reclining option will come in handy, as these chairs are incredibly comfortable for children, plus they are very likely to drift off. Our choice for #1 best child bike seat is the Thule Journey Along, that is a rear-mounted child bike chair that attaches to your seat post. It offers each of the premium features found on the best kid bike seats, plus some extras. Notable is you could tilt the couch with one side, to allow 5 different reclining alternatives for sleepy youngsters! It offers variable footrests and a height adjustable, padded safety harness with a kid proof safety buckle. In addition, it features springs for relaxation, a reversible, washable chair cover, and an instant release bracket. The body will protect your kids in the event that you fall, which is definitely typical of this design of seat. The chair is rated for kids from 9 months to 6 years good old, up to 48.5 lbs./22 kg.

Utilizing a rear-mounted child bicycle seats requires you to modify your feel of balance to presenting a weight in the trunk on the bike. Also, based on how agile you happen to be, you may find having on the bike to be a little bit of a learning curve!

Safety be aware: If your son or daughter is heavy (more than 30 pounds) and intensely dynamic, they could upset balance by making sudden big movements within the rear-mounted bike chair. This happened to Maggie when her oldest child was a kid, and almost triggered her to fall over. If this is the case with your kid, it could possibly be safer to use a bike trailer like the Burley Bee Trailer - check out our no. 5 choice below. Trailers possess the good thing about being very stable.

## No. 2: Rear-mounted Thule Yepp Maxi

Our no. 2 decision can be a rear-mounted child bike chair. The Thule Yepp Maxi  complies with stringent European security requirements and is qualified by the Dutch TNO Institute. It has earned these awards: Baby Technology Award Winner, Reddot Design Award Winner, Very good Industrial Design Winner, Dutch Style Award, and Fiets Progressive Award. This rear-mounted motorcycle chair attaches to your chair post and includes a 5-level harness, variable footrests, and shoulder pads for comfort and ease. It is rated to transport children up to 40 pounds (18 kg) and is designed to come to be theft-proof. You can view this bike seat at minute 4:00 of the video recording above, where it is ranked as 'the Cadillac of cycle seats'. However, we ranked it at no. 2 because we just like the 5 reclining options on the Thule Ride Along. Other than that, the no. 1 no. 2 options are extremely similar.

## Not any. 3: Front-Mounted Yepp Mini

Front-mounted bike chairs are suitable for very small children, up to age about 2 years old (unless your son or daughter is large for his or her age). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends you hold out until your child reaches least 12 a few months before adding them in a cycle seat. They also note that bicycle trailers (check out our no. 5 choice) are connected with fewer injuries (resource: AAP). On the other hand, you will see youngsters (from around age 9 a few months) being transported in bike seats in lots of countries. If your child can perfectly hold her or his brain up for long periods of time, then you can consider using front-mounted bicycle seats from about age 9 months.

Front-mounted bike seats including the Yepp Mini permit you to stay in constant communication with your very young child. Also, your child includes a great view!

You may find you must splay your knees a bit, which means this option isn't super comfortable, nonetheless it does permit you to keep your arms protectively around your child, and gauge if indeed they become distressed.

Mounting tip: You must have space on your bike's headset to add the seat. If your headset is certainly threaded, it has a locknut which you can adjust to create more space open to attach the bicycle seat, as displayed in the photography below.

Among front-mounted bike seats, among the highest rated is our very little. 3 choice, the Thule Yepp Mini.

## Zero 4: The Front-Mounted WeeRide Kangaroo Child Bike Seat

The front-mounted WeeRide Kangaroo Child Cycle Seat is another highly regarded front-mounted child bike seat, which is rated to carry children up to 40 pounds.

The front-mounted WeeRide Kangaroo Child Motorcycle Seat is another highly regarded front-mounted child bike seat, and is rated to carry children up to 40 pounds. The WeeRide Kangaroo Kid bike seat has many great features, including very thick seat and back padding, flexible footrests, and a plush headrest in leading for nap period. The training video below highlights the features, including the fact that this chair is mounted to the seat content and the headset, while resting on the cross bar, so that it is very secure.

The video above makes a lot of the features of a front-mounted seat compared to a rear-mounted seat. While there certainly are some advantages, the truth is that the decision of rear or front side mounting really boils down to this and size of the child. Once your kid is about two years old, you are most likely both going to become more comfortable having them in a rear-mounted motorcycle seat or a motorcycle trailer.

## Zero 5: The Burley Bee Child Trailer

Bike trailers have different significant advantages:

- You can transport more than one child, as displayed in the picture above.
- You can transport kids of varying age ranges. As most people tend to have kids who are NOT the same ages, this could be handy!
- There is absolutely no load on your own bike, so the stability of your bike is not affected. Some persons are more bothered by this feature than others. Maggie definitely loves a basket on leading of her bikes, but that front-weighted feeling would make me feel less in charge of the cycle, and I must say i don't enjoy it. This tends to be an individual thing. However, it's the explanation that I only ever use a motorcycle trailer, not a front or rear child bike chair, to transport kids.
- There exists a frame around your kids, which should help protect them in case of a fall.
- Your kids are secured from the rain and the wind a lot more than if they're in a seat.
- Also you can use the motorcycle trailer for your groceries, OR you can transport one young child and a pup. I attempted this once and my kid was outraged - especially when the dog involved threw up! Nevertheless, you might have a child who's more willing to talk about space with a pup (and a dog that will not get motion sick!)
- Most have yet another cargo area, thus they are very useful for picnics or for store shopping expeditions.

Of training course, you are pulling a trailer, and that means you have to understand that and ride accordingly. You will need up more space, and you will need even more space for maneuver such as for example overtaking. Likewise, if you want to have your eye on your child all the time, it is usually unnerving. I've always combined a motorcycle trailer with a rear view mirror, therefore i can keep an eyesight on my kids. These are cheap, and I always install them on all my bikes, as I love to know what is going on behind me. I believe rear viewpoint mirrors are an excellent (and strangely under-rated) safeness feature.

If you wish to try a bicycle trailer, the Burley Bee Child Trailer is probably the most trusted goods available to buy. I used to possess one myself, when my kids were little, and it lasted permanently. Burley is renowned because of their safety and durability testing, with a lot of its items ranked at up to 5 circumstances the ASTM typical. ASTM stands for American Contemporary society for Testing and Products, but the standards are essentially international. That is why Burley trailers last such a long time. It is also among the lowest priced ASTM-certified kid trailers, and is light.

This bike trailer offers a comfortable, fun trip for kids. They sit in a hammock-style chair, secured with a 5-point harness. A new innovation are tinted area and rear home windows with integrated UPF 30 to safeguard your kids from sunlight. This strong motorcycle trailer weighs just 20.5 lb, and permits you to transport up to two children. Safety features add a full internal roll cage, a choice of bright colorings, reflective piping, reflectors on the tires, and an orange basic safety flag. This bicycle trailer is ranked for up to 100 pounds (45 kg).

## No. 6: The WeeRide Co-Pilot Bike Trailer

These convenient machines are variously called tag along bikes, bike trailers, and other activities. The bottom line is that you can use them to get your youngsters into cycling properly. Your kids will be able to pedal, but you reach stay static in control! This WeeRide Co-Pilot Bicycle Trailer is extremely highly regarded by users. It is suggested for kids aged 4 to 9 years good old, who think about to 75 pounds. These devices itself weighs 24 pounds, so it is very best if your child helps with the pedaling, but it is not needed - the child can also just coast. It includes a safety flag.

It's great to find parents transporting their youngsters over bikes! I spotted these families on the separated bicycle lanes in downtown Vancouver

## No. #7: Cargo Bikes

You can utilize cargo bikes to move children of any age. You can see a cargo motorcycle from minute 5:05 of the first video recording in this article. Cargo bikes are hugely popular in European countries where bikes happen to be an important the main transport network. The cargo-carrying component may be at the front or the trunk.

Of study course, cargo bikes require a large initial outlay, but this will pay for itself as time passes. You can suit two kids and groceries generally in most cargo bikes. These bikes are very large, but an excellent one is reasonably simple to ride. If you need help, also you can consider an electric cargo bike, like this Morrison electrical cargo bike that's currently on KickStarter, that i wrote about here. Also you can read a lot more about cargo bikes for transporting children here.

This is an electric cargo bike, with the 'cargo' in this case being the kids at the back!
